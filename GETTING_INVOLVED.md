## Teams and Working Groups
The Community Committee is a Committee that represents a collection of teams and working groups that are expressly working toward growing and supporting the overall Node.js community. These teams and working groups need a broad range of skills and allow you to offer contributions that are not necessarily technical in nature.

You can see the current teams and working groups in the ["Teams and Working Groups"]() section of the README.md file - if there is one that seems to cover an area of particular interest to you, you should take a look at the Team or Working Group's repo to see how you can get further involved.
