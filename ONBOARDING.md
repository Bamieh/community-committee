# Community Committee Member Onboarding
The goal of this document is to provide a set of shared context for new and existing Community Committee members to work from.

## Elevated Guidelines for Community Committee Members
Community Committee members are held to following the [Membership Policy](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MemberExpectations.md).

## Repositories
* The [Community Committee repository](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) is the administrative repository for CommComm discussions.
* The [Admin repository](https://github.com/nodejs/admin) is a place for meta discussions about the project, GitHub org, travel fund, and so on between the Node.js Community Committee and the Node.js Technical Steering Committee.
* The [Moderation repository](https://github.com/nodejs/moderation) (a private repository) is for tracking issues related to Moderation.

## Travel Fund
There is a [travel fund](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md) available to contributors to Node.js, including members of the Community Committee. There are a few criteria before travel fund requests can be merged, so please be sure to read the [MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md) document fully.
