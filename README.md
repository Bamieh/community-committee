# Community Committee

The Community Committee is a top-level committee in the Node.js Foundation focused on community-facing efforts.

For more details read the [Community Committee Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), adopted by the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors on March 10th 2017.

## Why does the Community Committee exist?

The Community Committee reflects a formal role and the relevance of the voice of community in the governance of the Node.js project. The formation of this group as a committee alongside the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) demonstrates that community-focused contributions are valued by the contributors of Node.js, and that roles other than those of code contributor help foster a healthy, sustainable open source community.

The Community Committee works to empower people in every part of the project. By making the Node.js project more diverse and improving the environment for inclusivity, we attract a wider range of views, voices, and opinions, which in turn helps us ship better software.

For that reason, we advocate for the usage of a Code of Conduct. We've also learned that our goals are not easily accomplished with that alone. Community Committee initiatives and the related working groups are formed with the intent of improving the cultural development and outreach within the Node.js Foundation, and are therefore suited to engaging people with non-coding skill sets to contribute as well.

## Contributing
> code commits !== the only means to contributions.

The Community Committee is tasked with further building out the Node.js Community.
If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community and we'd love to
have your help!

Before you get started, here's a broad outline of the Community Committee's governance structure:

- Community Committee (meta-level concerns, cross-cutting with other teams)
  - Initiatives (focused on specific tasks, independent from the Community Committee). For example, the Website Redesign Initiative, which is focused on a complete redesign of the https://nodejs.org website
  - Working Groups (like initiatives, but more autonomous and broad in scope)

As seen here, most of the community work that immediately affects the project is
done within the numerous **initiatives**. We recommend checking the list of initiatives
below and getting involved with one that you find interesting! If nothing suits
your fancy and you have concrete ideas, open an issue here! We can help to point
you in the right direction.

To **get started** with contributing, you should read the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
document. This document details the roles you can take on. It also includes a guide
to contributing and links to `good first issue`s where we're looking for help.

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee directly, you should
create an issue asking to be an Observer in our next Community Committee meeting.
You can find a great example of such an issue [here](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/142)!

## Meetings

Community Committee meetings will be broadcast via Zoom, will be announced ahead of time for access, and coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.

## Current Initiatives, Teams, and Working Groups

### Initiatives
Initiatives are projects that the Community Committee and the broader community members are collaborating on to enable Node.js across the ecosystem. A complete list of current initiatives is available at [STRATEGIC-INITIATIVES.md](./STRATEGIC-INITIATIVES.md).

If you're looking to get started with participating, the following are fairly straightforward initiatives that could use your help:
