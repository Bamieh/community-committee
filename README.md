# Community Committee

The Community Committee is a top-level committee in the Node.js Foundation focused on community-facing efforts. 

For more details read the [Community Committee Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), adopted by the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors on March 10th 2017.

## Contributing
> code commits !== the only means to contributions.

The Community Committee is tasked with further building out the Node.js Community. If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community.

As a part of the Node.js Community, we'd love to have your help! To **get started** with contributing, you can check out the Issues in this repository labeled "Good First Issue" to see where we're looking for help. If you have your own ideas on how we could engage and build the community, feel free to create your own issue!

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee as a member, you should create an issue asking to be an Observer in our next Community Committee meeting. You can find a great example of such an issue [here](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/142)!

Community Committee meetings will be broadcast via Google Hangouts, will be announced ahead of time for access, and coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.
