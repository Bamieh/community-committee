# Community Committee
The Community Committee reflects a formal role and the relevance of the voice of community for the governance of Node.js Foundation.

Community activities, such as ecosystem projects and events, fall outside of the realm of code and documentation that the TSC oversees. Node.js' leadership is instantiated in a Board of Directors. There are are number of organizations that have absolutely contributed to the growth of Node.js--NodeSchool, NodeBots, and thousands of individual meetups. This is not an exhaustive list.The champions of these organizations have very different skillsets, talents, and concerns. The community organizations of Node.js have long been important to the growth and vitality of the project and will be recognized as the Community Committee(CC) as represented on the Board by the existing Individual Membership Board Directors.

The CC is an automonous group operating adjacent to the TSC but is excited to collaborate with and be inspired by the lessons learned and wins celebrated in the many years of Node.js development. It is the hope that members of the TSC and CC will participate in each others' meetings, to provide informed perspectives on the direction with which the CC will move forward.

## What is this repo?
This repository is for bootstrapping the the Community Committee with existing structures. There was consideration for creation of a separate GitHub organization to establish this committee, as it runs adjacent to the TSC and the TSC currently oversees all repositories under the /nodejs org. The concern for this being too separate(and ironically so as the Community org) as a separate organization to start overrode the need for administrative permissions separations. This will be addressed in future issues and pull requests.

## Contributing
code commits !== the only means to contributions

Please contribute! The best way to do that right now is watching this repo, participating in the issues, and asking questions in TSC meetings as they help to advise the formation of this autonomous committee.

Meetings will be broadcast via call, will be announced ahead of time for access, and coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.

## Governance and Current Members

The Community Committee is an autonomous committee that collaborates alongside the TSC and whose governance is strongly influenced by the TSC's example. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) to learn more about the group's evolving structure and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance about the expectations for all contributors to this project.
